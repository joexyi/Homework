  *This homework is due September 5th 6pm.*
  
  (This set of exercise is mostly taken from R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.)

# Exercise 1

1.  What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```
    
    Answer: The parenthesis of aes should not wrap around color. This causes the code to be run in a way where 'blue' is read as a variable. The correct code would be:

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
    ```

2.  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
    (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How
    can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

    Answer:
    Categorical: manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class
    
    Continuous: displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy
    You can determine which is continuous and which is categorical by looking at their data type . If it is character, it is categorical, if it is integer, or dbl the variable is continuous.

    ```{r}
  
library(tidyverse)
mpg
    ```

3.  Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape`. How do
    these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous
    variables? 
    
    Answer: When you map color and size to a continuous variable, the color or size has a gradient which the value of the continuous variable defines. For shape, there is no way to represent a higher or lower value based on the shape thus it is not possible to plot continuous variables using shape. However, if there are only 2-3 values in a continuous variable, you can plot it but R will treat it like a categorical variable.

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty))
    ```

4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 

    Answer: You get a nice plot where the aesthetics you map to this variable are alligned to their respective value. Makes for a nicer looking plot if you don't have a need for some aesthetics or a viewer is colorblind.

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv, shape = drv))
    ```

5.  What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
    (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
    
    Answer: The stroke aesthetic modifies the width of the border of the circle shape.

    ```{r}
    ?geom_point

    
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", fill = "white", size = 5, stroke = 5)
    ```

6.  What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable 
    name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?  

    Answer: R creates a dichotomy of True and False for the condition that was defined in the color statement. True is blue, False is red.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))

    ```


# Exercise 2

1.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r eval= FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

    Answer: Empty cells in the facet grid mean there doesn't exist a combination of these categorical variable. For example, a car with 5 cylinder engine and 4/rear wheel drive does not exist.

    ```{r}
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl)) + 
    facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
    ```

2.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

    Answer: facet_grid(x ~ y) where x represents rows and y represent the columns. If you put '.' in place of x or y, you do not get the row/column breakdown by the categorical variable's values.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

3.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
    Answer: The advantage of using faceting is if there are continuous variables from multiple categories overlap a lot, there is too much clutter. The disadvantage of faceting is the inability to directly compare data on the same plot. When there is a larger dataset, faceting's advantages outweight its cons as data points that cluster will become too overwhelming for points to be distinguished from one another especially if there are multiple shapes (and same color) in play.

    ```{r}
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```

# Exercise 3

1.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? 
    A histogram? An area chart?

    Answer: Line chart = geom_smooth, Boxplot=geom_boxplot, Histogram = geom_histogram, Area chart = geom_area 

    ```{r}
    
    ```

2.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

    Answer: There should be one scatter plot with a line graph layered on top. The x axis is the engine displacement in liters, y axis is the highway miles per gallon. The categorization of the wheel drive is colored. I'm not sure what se = False does but geom_smooth creates a line.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

3.  What does `show.legend = FALSE` do?  What happens if you remove it?  
    Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

    Answer: show.legend = FALSE hides the legend for the aesthetic for the non-axis variables (mapped variables). If you remove it, by default, the legend shows for any mapped variables that aren't already labeled by the axises. The earlier plot used it because the 2 plots in that group already told you how the 3 lines are differentiated. If you add a legend, it would just be redundant.

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = TRUE
  )
    ```

4.  What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?


    Answer: se = TRUE displays the confidence interval around the geom_smooth line.

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = TRUE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
    ```

5.  Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() + 
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    ```

    Answer: They should be the same since the geom_point and geom_smooth will default to the mapping in the ggplot(). Thus it would produce the same plot

    ```{r}

    ```

6.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
    
    ![Smooth lines for each `drv`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306A.png?raw=true"`)
    
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
    ggplot() +
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
    ```


    ![A single smooth line, transparency by `year`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306B.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
  ggplot() +
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv, alpha = year)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = FALSE)
    ```

    
    ![Layered dots and an additional text information](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306C.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Adding texts was not covered in class, but give it a try!
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x =displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = 'white') +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  annotate('text', x = 2.6, y = 44, label = 'Max hwy = 44')
    ```

# Exercise 4

1.  What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could
    you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the 
    stat function?

    Answer: The default geom is geom_pointrange.

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
    geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth), stat = 'summary',
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
    )
    ```

2.  What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

    Answer: Geom_col makes the heights of the bars to represent values in the data and uses the identity stat. Geom_bar makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group. 

    ```{r}
?geom_col
    ```

3.  What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control
    its behaviour?

    Answer: stat_smooth computes y (predicted value), ymin, ymax, and standard error (same as geom_smooth). It uses the x, y, method, standard error, and formula parameters to calculate a smooth line/curve to fit the data.

    ```{r}
?stat_smooth

    
    ```

# Exercise 5

1.  What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

    Answer: There is a lot of overplotting due to data consisting of cars with the same cty and hwy so you don't actually see if there are a more cars in a general area or scattered throughout (as this plot suggests). To fix it, we can jitter the plot.

    ```{r}

  ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point(position = 'jitter')
    ```

2.  What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

    Answer: width= and height= controls the amount of horizontal and vertical noise respectively.

    ```{r}
  ?geom_jitter
    ```

3.  Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

    Answer: geom_jitter helps distinguish points that are overplotted by shifting from theiri true value. Geom_count counts points that are in the same location and increases their size so you can see the larger circles at locations where points overlap. This helps distinguish where points are concentrated without losing their true x and y value.

    ```{r}
?geom_count
    ```

# Exercise 6

1.  Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using `coord_polar()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(class)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = drv)) +
  coord_polar()
    ```

2.  What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.

    Answer: labs() sets axis,legend, title, caption, and subtitle labels in the individual scales. 

    ```{r}
?labs()
    ```

3.  What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city
    and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does 
    `geom_abline()` do?
    
    ```{r, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%"}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline() +
      coord_fixed()
    ```

    Answer: The figure shows as city miles per gallon increases, the highway miles per gallon increases as well.  coord_fixed() ensures the line created by geom_abline() is at a 45 degree angle. This helps the viewer see how the data compares to the line of city mpg vs highway mpg. geom_abline() creates a line on the graph that can be customized. The default uses the x and y variables to plot y=x. Otherwise, you can manually input the function by inputting slope and intercept. 

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline()
    ```
